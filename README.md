# Natural Language Inference

This repository contains code for the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task that involves determining the relationship between a pair of sentences, classified as entailment, contradiction, or neutral.
The code provided here demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model on an NLI dataset and evaluate its performance.

## Installation
```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

## Model

You can find the finetuned version of XLM-RoBERTa (Large) for this specific NLI task on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/ajayat/xlm-roberta-large-xnli).
